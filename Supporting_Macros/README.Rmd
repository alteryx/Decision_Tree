#### Usage

__R Code__

1. Edit `Decision_Tree1.R` to update the logic of the tool. 
2. Use the [style guide](Style_Guide.md) while writing your R code. 
3. Use the `Data` folder to store any data used. 
4. Run `insertRcode("Decision_Tree.yxmc", "Decision_Tree1.R")` to insert R code back into the macro. Note that you will have to close and reopen the macro for the changes in the R tool to take effect.

#### Configuration Parameters

This configuration is autogenerated from `Decision_Tree.yxmc`.


```{r echo = F}
library(AlteryxRhelper)
d <- generateConfigurationTable('Decision_Tree.yxmc')
knitr::kable(d, format = 'markdown')
```
